# Human Resources Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
The HR Insight Dashboard consolidates and visualizes data from multiple departments within the organization, providing a comprehensive overview of critical HR key performance indicators (KPIs) to enhance decision-making. This dashboard allows HR teams to obtain a high-level view of their operations while also exploring how specific data points interrelate. By utilizing this tool, HR professionals can identify patterns, develop proactive strategies, and quickly uncover insights that improve recruitment processes, optimize workplace management, and enhance employee performance. The dashboard is created using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) and Power Query in Microsoft Excel, transforming raw data into actionable visualizations.

## Dataset Used
The dataset is provided in CSV format and contains rough, unprocessed data regarding employee records from 2019 to 2021. Using Power Query, the data was cleaned and transformed into an analyzable format. 

## Key Steps in the Project
- **Data Extraction and Transformation**: 
   - Utilized Power Query to extract raw, unstructured data and transform it into structured, tabular form for better analysis and visualization.
- **Pivot Table Generation**: 
   - Generated pivot tables to compile and summarize key HR data, allowing for the creation of detailed and informative reports.
- **Excel Macros Development**: 
   - Developed a series of useful Excel macros to automate the display and concealment of job categorization cards, incorporating tabular information to enhance user interaction and data visibility.
- **Filter Automation**: 
   - Automated the removal of manual filters using macros and VBA, streamlining the data analysis process and improving efficiency.
- **Formula Application**: 
   - Applied Excel formulae, such as IF, COUNTA, and IF AND functions, to perform transition chart analysis and employee promotional analysis, ensuring accurate and insightful data representation.
